## Problem Statement

In Afghanistan, the national citizenship ID card (Tazkira) was previously issued on A4 or Letter-sized paper. Currently, the issuance of this paper-based ID card (Tazkira) poses several challenges, including security issues, incorrect information, and the absence of an exact date of birth.

Determining the age of an individual is currently based on two primary criteria:

1. **Physical Appearance:** The age is assessed based on the applicant's physical face, body, and height appearance.
   
2. **Father's Claims:** The age is also determined based on the claims made by the applicant's father.

Here is an example of how age is defined in the Tazkira: "Based on his/her physical appearance, 10 years old in the year 1385 (in the Afghan Solar Calendar) is defined as the age."

## Solution

Introducing the **MyAge** app, which aims to address the challenges associated with the birth date determining system. This app provides users with the ability to:

- **Find Born Year (Solar Calendar):** Users can determine the year of birth based on the information available in the Tazkira.

- **Date Range in Gregorian Calendar:** The app converts the born year to the Gregorian (Miladi) calendar and provides a date range, allowing users to have a more precise understanding of the birthdate.

- **Comparison Feature:** Users can compare the calculated birthdate with a date of their choice, facilitating verification and ensuring accuracy.

## How to Use

1. **Age defined in the year of Solar Calendar:**
   - Provide the relevant details from the Tazkira, including defined age and year of defination.

2. **Get Born Year:**
   - The app will calculate and display the born year based on the provided information.

3. **View Gregorian Date Range:**
   - Convert the born year to the Gregorian calendar and view the corresponding date range.

4. **Compare with Entered Date:**
   - Enter a specific date for comparison to ensure accuracy.
